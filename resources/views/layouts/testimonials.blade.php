     <p style="font-size: 20px">    Mentorship is crucial for any individual whether a student or professional, and its importance is essential especially during the formative years in college. I signed up for this programme with the objective to gain perspective and seek help from our experienced and extremely friendly alumni. His guidance helped me think and understand about the outside world, gain industry knowledge and valuable fundas which helped me perform well in college and outside. They know what is valued more when it comes to the professional world, hence I always prioritized my mentors advice - specifically maintaining a good CGPA. Interacting and keeping in touch with my mentor also helped improving my networking skills and connecting to more people.

    <p  style="font-size: 20px">      The Alumni Student mentorship programme is a nice initiative by the Students’ Alumni Cell. In today’s time a direction and support from an esteemed mentor can go a long way in helping someone. It was a great experience for me as I got to learn a lot from my mentor who provided me with insight into the world after college as well as their experience as a student and in the professional sphere. Getting mentorship from an Alumni is a great thing as they can provide better help as they have been a part of the same institution as you."

  <p  style="font-size: 20px">The Student Alumni Mentorship Programme is probably one of the best
   initiatives taken by our institution in recent years. Through my
   association with it, I can only say that although the path was clear for
   me, it was dark. My mentor came in the form a torchlight.
